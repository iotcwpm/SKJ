{\ttfamily ioskj} is a simulation model of the Indian Ocean skipjack tuna fishery for management strategy evaluation.

\subsection*{Status}

{\ttfamily ioskj} is still under active development. It requires several third party C++ libraries and a modern C++ compiler which supports the C++11 standard. At this stage we do not recommend trying to compile it yourself. As the model matures we hope to make it available as precompiled executables for Windows and Linux and/or a package for R.

\subsection*{Organisation}

\subsubsection*{C++ files}

The main C++ files are\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{dimensions_8hpp_source}{dimensions.\-hpp}} -\/ defines the dimensions used in various model arrays e.\-g. {\ttfamily Region}, {\ttfamily Age}, {\ttfamily Method}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{fish_8hpp_source}{fish.\-hpp}} -\/ contains the {\ttfamily Fish} class representing the fish population dynamic
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{fishing_8hpp_source}{fishing.\-hpp}} -\/ contains the {\ttfamily Fishing} class representing fishing activity
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{data_8hpp_source}{data.\-hpp}} -\/ reads in and holds data for use in driving and conditioning the model
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{model_8hpp_source}{model.\-hpp}} -\/ contains the {\ttfamily Model} class which puts {\ttfamily Fish}, {\ttfamily Fishing} and the various data classes together
\item {\ttfamily main.\-cpp} -\/ the primary C++ file for compiling a {\ttfamily Model} executable
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily data} folder}

The {\ttfamily data} folder includes R and Python scripts for processing source data. See the documentation in those files for more details. The resulting, processed data is outputted to the folder {\ttfamily data\textbackslash{}processed-\/data}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily docs} folder}

The {\ttfamily docs} folder includes hand written documentation and a Doxygen project for automatically generating documentation from C++ source code/
