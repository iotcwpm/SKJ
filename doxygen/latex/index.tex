The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission's (I\-O\-T\-C) Working Party on Methods' (W\-P\-M) simulation model of the Indian Ocean skipjack (S\-K\-J) tuna fishery for management strategy evaluation (M\-S\-E).

\subsection*{Status}

The model is still under active development. It requires several third party C++ libraries and a modern C++ compiler which supports the C++11 standard. At this stage we do not recommend trying to compile it yourself. As the model matures we hope to make it available as precompiled executables for Windows and Linux and/or a package for R.

\subsection*{Documentation}

A description of the model, priors and data, including equations is available at \href{http://iotcwpm.github.io/SKJ/}{\tt http\-://iotcwpm.\-github.\-io/\-S\-K\-J/}

C++ code documentation, generated by Doxygen is available at \href{http://iotcwpm.github.io/SKJ/doxygen/html/index.html}{\tt http\-://iotcwpm.\-github.\-io/\-S\-K\-J/doxygen/html/index.\-html}

\subsection*{Organisation}

\subsubsection*{C++ files}

The C++ code is divided into several files\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}{\ttfamily \hyperlink{imports_8hpp_source}{imports.\-hpp}}\mbox{]} -\/ {\ttfamily \#include}s to import classes and functions from external libraries
\item \mbox{[}{\ttfamily \hyperlink{dimensions_8hpp_source}{dimensions.\-hpp}}\mbox{]} -\/ defines the dimensions used in various model arrays e.\-g. {\ttfamily Region}, {\ttfamily Age}, {\ttfamily Method}
\item \mbox{[}{\ttfamily \hyperlink{model_8hpp_source}{model.\-hpp}}\mbox{]} -\/ contains the {\ttfamily Model} class which specifies the structure and dynamics of the fishery
\item \mbox{[}{\ttfamily \hyperlink{parameters_8hpp_source}{parameters.\-hpp}}\mbox{]} -\/ contains the {\ttfamily Parameters} class which defines the parameters and their priors used for model conditioning
\item \mbox{[}{\ttfamily \hyperlink{data_8hpp_source}{data.\-hpp}}\mbox{]} -\/ contains the {\ttfamily Data} class which defines the data sets and their likelihoods used for model conditioning
\item \mbox{[}{\ttfamily ioskj.\-cpp}\mbox{]} -\/ the primary C++ file for compiling the executable
\item \mbox{[}{\ttfamily tests.\-cpp}\mbox{]} -\/ unit tests of the C+ code
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily priors} folder}

The {\ttfamily priors} folder includes R scripts for background analyses for developing model prior probability distributions.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily data} folder}

The {\ttfamily data} folder includes R and Python scripts for processing source data. See the documentation in those files for more details. The resulting, processed data is outputted to the folder {\ttfamily data\textbackslash{}processed-\/data}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily docs} folder}

The {\ttfamily docs} folder includes hand written documentation and a Doxygen project for automatically generating documentation from C++ source code.
