    <detaileddescription>
<para><computeroutput>indi</computeroutput> is a C++ library for individual-based (a.k.a agent-based) models of fisheries. It was developed to implement an IBM for the Indian Ocean skipjack fishery on behalf of the Maldives Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture (see /projects/io-skipjack/).
