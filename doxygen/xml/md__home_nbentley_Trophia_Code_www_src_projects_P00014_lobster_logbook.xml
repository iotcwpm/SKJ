<para>Title: P00014: New Zealand Rock Lobster Industry Voluntary Logbook Programme</para><para>Principal Investigator: Nokome bentley Researchers: Nathan Walker Status: Completed Rock lobster fishers in many parts of New Zealand keep logbooks in which they record the size, sex and stage of maturity for the lobsters they catch. Currently logbook data is used in the stock assessment process and to generate annual summaries to participants. The extensive nature of the logbook sampling provides data that is more representative of the catch than intensive research sampling. As a consequence, the new size-structured model, used in stock assessments for 1998, performed better in those areas where the logbook scheme was operating.</para><para>This project is funded by the New Zealand Rock Lobster Industry Council.</para><para>Click link below to find out more Click for document </para>    </detaileddescription>
