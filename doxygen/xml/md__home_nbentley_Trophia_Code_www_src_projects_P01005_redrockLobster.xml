It complemented objective 8 of the 2000-01 Ministry of Fisheries rock lobster research project, which was to examine the relationship between recruitment indices derived from puerulus collectors, juvenile dive surveys and the observer and logbook catch sampling programmes and make recommendations on the most appropriate way of predicting recruitment to the fishery.</para><para>Information gained from this study was used to design a long-term monitoring program for pre-recruits in CRA8.</para><para>Click link below to find out more Click for document Hart, A.M. ; Surveys of pre-recruits of Jasus edwardsii in CRA 8 using modified commercial pots � a pilot study.
