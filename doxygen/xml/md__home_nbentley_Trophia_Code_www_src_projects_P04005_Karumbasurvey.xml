This study is the second carried out by Trophia in this series and focused on the tourist fishery sub component.</para><para>The objectives were:</para><para>To estimate catch, effort and mean size of the principal target species during the May-June strata of the tourist fishery sub-component of the Karumba recreational fishery. To obtain estimates of mean and variability in harvest rates of the principal target species during the tourist fishery sub-component of the Karumba recreational fishery. To link up data from this report with an initial pilot study and establish a draft catch and effort estimate for the overall tourist fishery over the 4 month period (1st May â€“ to 31th August).
