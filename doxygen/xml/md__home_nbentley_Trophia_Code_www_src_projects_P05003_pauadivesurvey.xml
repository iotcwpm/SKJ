The specific objectives for this project include:</para><para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>To undertake a review of the utility of research surveys in stock assessment models for paua and make recommendations on the design and application of future surveys.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
</para><para>The status of paua stocks is determined by periodic stock assessments using fishery independent dive surveys to assess the abundance and estimate biomass, and catch rate and catch history data. A critical component of the stock assessment methodology is the dive survey to measure relative abundance. Dive surveys can be conducted in one year followed by a stock assessment the following year.</para><para>A Final Research Report is available from this site.</para><para>Hart, A.M.
