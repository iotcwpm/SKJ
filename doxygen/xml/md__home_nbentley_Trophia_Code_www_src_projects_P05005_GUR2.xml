<para>Title: P05005: Relative abundance of red gurnard in GUR 2</para><para>Principal Investigator: Terese Kendrick Researchers:</para><para>Status: Completed Trophia has been contracted by the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries (MFish) to monitor the abundance of red gurnard (Chelidonichthys kumu) GUR 2 using Catch and Effort data. . The specific objectives for this project include:</para><para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>To update the standardised CPUE indices for GUR 2 using data up to the end of 2004/2005.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
</para><para>Relative abundance of this Fishstock is monitored using the age structure of the catch (2-3 years in every 5) and an index of abundance based on standardized CPUE from bottom trawls targeting FLA 2, TAR 2 and GUR 2 (updated every 3 years). The previous CPUE analysis updated the series to 2000/01 and produced a gradually declining trend. The purpose of this project is to update the standardized cpue index for GUR 2 to the end of the 2004/05 fishing year.</para><para>This work is funded by MFish project GUR2005/01 </para>    </detaileddescription>
