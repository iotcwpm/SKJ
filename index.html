		<h1>ioskj: a simulation model of the Indian Ocean skipjack tuna fishery</h1>
		<p class="note">
			This documentation is a draft under active development. Separate documentation, generated from the model's C++ source code, is also
			<a href="doxygen/html/index.html">available</a>
			.
		</p>
		<section id="introduction">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This document describes a simulation model for the skipjack fishery in the Indian Ocean. The model has been designed for use in simulation based evaluation of alternative management strategies for the fishery. This document outlines the structure of the model, describes prior probability distributions for model parameters, model conditioning algorithms and conditioning results.</p>
			<p>The model, and consequently this document, are under development. The approach has been to start simple and add complexity as required. Potential alternative model forumations are noted throughout the document.</p>
			<section id="symbols">
				<h3>Symbols</h3>
				<p>The following convention is used for assigning symbols for the model: Greek lower case letters (e.g. `alpha`) for model parameters, Roman capital letters (e.g. `N`) for model variables, and Roman lower case letters for variable or parameter array subscripts (e.g. `N_{r,a,s}`, `phi_{r}`). Using this convention means that in some instances model parameters are given different symbols that usual (e.g. `nu` instead of `M` for natural mortality) but has the advantage of clearly distinquishing model parameters from model variables.</p>
				<p>The subscript for time, `t`, is usually omitted from the model equations below except where it is necessary to be explicit regarding the time step involved.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="dimensions">
			<h2>Dimensions</h2>
			<p>Several dimensions are used to partition aspects of the model (e.g. fish numbers, catches).</p>
			<h3>Time (`t`)</h3>
			<p>The model uses a quarterly, i.e. three month, time step. Each time step, `t`, has an associated calendar year (`y`) and calendar quarter (`q`).</p>
			<h3>Region (`r`)</h3>
			<p>There are three regions, West (`we`), Maldives (`ma`) and East (`ea`). The term "region" is used in preference to "area" becausing using the latter would confound the `a` subscript which is also used for age.</p>
			<h3>Age (`a`)</h3>
			<p>Fish recruit to the model in each quarter and the model keeps track of their numbers by their age, in quarters up to siz years i.e. `0,1,2,...,23`</p>
			<h3>Size (`s`)</h3>
			<p>Fish size is represented in fourty, 2mm bins, `0-2, 2-4, ..., 78-80mm`.</p>
			<h3>Method (`m`)</h3>
			<p>
				Five fishing methods are defined (Table 1), See
				<a href="data-catches">Catches</a>
				for a description of how nominal catches were assigned to each of these methods and regions.

			<h2>Fish</h2>
			<section id="fish-numbers">
				<h3>Numbers</h3>
				<p>Fish numbers are partitioned by region, age and size, `N_{r,a,s}`. In each quarter, recruitment to the model and ageing occur as follows.</p>
				<p>The maximum age group, `vec(a)`, accumulates fish from the previous age, `vec(a)-1`,</p>
				<p class="equation">`N_{r,bar(a),s} = N_{r,vec(a),s} + N_{r,vec(a)-1,s}`</p>
				<p>For ages `1` to `vec(a)-1`, simple ageing occurs, </p>
				<p class="equation">`N_{r,a,s} = N_{r,a-1,s}`</p>
				<p>For age `0`, recruitment occurs,</p>
				<p class="equation">`N_{r,0,s} = R_{r,s}`</p>
				<p>where `R_{r,s}` is the number of fish recruiting to age 0 in region `r` at size `s`.</p>
				<p>Numbers are updated by applying growth, survival, exploitation and movement. The numbers in each region, in each age class and size class are determined by summing over all regions and size classes,</p>
				<p class="equation">`N_{r,a,s} = sum_{dot(r) in {we,ma,ea},dot(s)=0...vec(s)}( dot(N)_{dot(r),a,dot(s)} G_{dot(s),s} e^-nu (1-E_{dot(r),dot(s)}) M_{dot(r),r} )`</p>
				<p>where `G` is the growth transition matrix, `nu` is the rate of natural mortality, `E` is the exploitation rate, and `M` is the movement transition matrix.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="fish-length">
				<h3>Length</h3>
				<p>The length of fish of size `s` is the midpoint of the bin size,</p>
				<p class="equation">`L_s = 2s+1`</p>
			</section>
			<section id="fish-weight">
				<h3>Weight</h3>
				<p>The weight of fish of size `s` is modelled as an exponential curve,</p>
				<p class="equation">`W_s = alpha (L_s)^beta`</p>
				<div class="note">Parameters of the length-weight relationship could vary by region i.e. `alpha_{r}, beta_{r}`</div>
			</section>
			<section id="fish-maturity">
				<h3>Maturity</h3>
				<p>The proportion of fish of size `s` that are mature is modelled as a logistic curve,</p>
				<p class="equation">`O_s = 1/(1+19^(tau-L_s)/upsilon)`</p>
				<div class="note">Maturity could be a function of age, rather than size, i.e. `O_a`, and/or vary by region i.e. `alpha_{r}, beta_{r}`</div>
			</section>
			<section id="fish-spawning">
				<h3>Spawning</h3>
				<p>The proportion of mature fish that spawn in each quarter is allowed to vary according to a model parameter,</p>
				<p class="equation">`rho_q`</p>
			</section>
			<section id="fish-recruitment">
				<h3>Recruitment</h3>
				<p>Recruitment occurs in each quarter and is partitioned by region and size, `R_{r,s}`. The total number of recruits is based on the total spawning biomass in the previous quarter,</p>
				<p class="equation">`S = sum_{r in {we,ma,ea},a=0...vec(a),s=0...vec(s)} N_{r,a,s} O_s W_s rho_q`</p>
				<p>where `O_s` is the proportion of fish that are mature at size `s`, `W_s` is the weight of fish at size `s`, and `rho_q` is the proportion of fish that spawn in quarter `q`.</p>
				<p>The total spawning biomass is used as the basis for determining a recruitment over all three regions, `bar(R)` based on the Beverton-Holt stock recruitment function,</p>
				<p class="equation">`bar(R) = 4 eta theta S/((5 eta-1) S + dot(S)  (1-eta)) D`</p>
				<p>where `eta` is steepness, `lambda` and `dot(S)` are the respectively the recruitment and spawning biomass in the absence of fishing, and `D` is the recruitment deviation which is lognormally distributed with mean of 1 and standard deviation of `sigma`.</p>
				<p>This recruitment is divided equally across the three regions,</p>
				<p class="equation">`R_{r,s} = bar(R)/3 * phi_s`</p>
				<p>where `phi_s` is the proportion of recruits of size `s` which is based on a normal distribution with mean, `mu` and standard deviation `zeta`,</p>
				<p class="equation">`phi_s = 1/sqrt(2 pi zeta^2) e^(-((L_s-mu)^2)// 2 zeta^2)`</p>
				<div class="note">Currently, recruitment is pooled across all areas and divided equally. This could be changed via a recruitment dispersal matrix.</div>
			</section>
			<section id="fish-natural-mortality">
				<h3>Natural mortality</h3>
				<p>Natural mortality is modelled as a constant instantaeous rate that is uniform over all regions, ages and sizes.</p>
				<div class="note">Natural mortality could vary by region and/or age i.e. `nu_{r,a}` or size `nu_{r,s}` or even time.</div>
			</section>
			<section id="fish-growth">
				<h3>Growth</h3>
				 
				<p>Growth is described using a size transition matrix of the proportion of fish growing from size `dot(s)` to size `s` in one quarter</p>
				<p class="equation">`G_{dot(s),s}`</p>
				<p>This transition matrix is calculated based on the von Bertallanfy growth function. The mean increment in one quarter is,</p>
				<p class="equation">`I_s = (lambda-L_s)(1-e^{-kappa})`</p>
				<p>with a standard deviation, `varphi`.</p>
				<div class="todo">Equations for calculation of `G_{dot(s),s}`: use Hillary (2010) approach or more convential approach?</div>
				<div class="note">An alternative would be to use the two-stanza growth model and estimates of Everson et al (2012).</div>
				<div class="note">Growth could vary by region and/or time e.g `lambda_{r}`. `kappa_{t}`</div>
			</section>
			<section id="fish-movement">
				<h3>Movement</h3>
				<p>The proportion of fish moving from region `dot(r)` to region `r` in one quarter is described by the movement matrix defined by six off-diagonal parameters,</p>
				<p class="equation">`M_{dot(r),r} = [[1-omega_{ea,ma}-omega_{ea,we},omega_{ea,ma},omega_{ea,we}],[omega_{ma,ea},1-omega_{ma,ea}-omega_{ma,we},omega_{ma,we}],[omega_{we,ea},omega_{we,ma},1-omega_{we,ea}-omega_{we,ma}]]`</p>
				<div class="note">There could be separate movement parameters for each age (or size) e.g. `omega_{ma,we,a}`, or more simply, the relative proportion of fish moving could vary by age (or size) e.g. `M_{ma,we,a} =  omega_{ma,we} zeta_a`.</div>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="fishing">
			<h2>Fishing</h2>
			<section id="fishing-exploitation">
				<h3>Exploitation rate</h3>
				<p>The biomass that is vulnerable to each method, `m` in each region `r`, is calculated by summing over ages and sizes,</p>
				<p class="equation">`V_{r,m} = sum_{a=0,...,vec(a),s=0,...,vec(s)} N_{r,a,s} W_s P_{m,s}`</p>
				<p>where `P_{m,s}` is the relative selectivity of method `m` for fish of size, `s`.</p>
				<div class="todo">Determine best way to parameterize selectivity ogives e.g. logistic, splines etc.</div>
				<p>The exploitation rate of method `m` in region `r` is then,</p>
				<p class="equation">`E_{r,s} = C_{r,m}/V_{r,m}`</p>

			<h2>Priors</h2>
			Table 2 summarises the priors used for each model parameter. This section provides further notes where necessary on the derivation of priors.
			<section id="priors-weight">
				<h3>Weight</h3>
				<p>Priors for length-weight parameters were based on those used in Sharma et al (2012) with a coefficient of variation of 5%.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="priors-maturity">
				<h3>Maturity</h3>
				<p>Priors for maturity ogive parameters were based on the results of Grande (2013). For the inflection point a normal prior with mean of 40cm and a coefficient of variation of 5% was used. Note that Table 4.2 of Grande (2013) indicates that some earlier studies in the Indian Ocean estimated values around 42-43cm for the inflection point. </p>
				<p>Figure 7.3 of Grande (2013) shows 5% and 95% maturity at about 35cm and 44cm respectively. Given a 50% maturity of 40cm this corresponds to a steepness of the maturity ogive of about 5cm. A normal distribution with a mean of 5cm and a 10% c.v. was used.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="priors-spawning">
				<h3>Spawning</h3>
				<p>In the western Indian Ocean, skipjack spawning appears to occur all year but with periods of greater activity during the North-east monsoon (November to March) and South-west monsoon (June to July) (Grande 2013 and references cited therein). Grande (2013) summarised the percentage of fish in the "spawning capable" phase in the months January to July. This percentage was highest during January and February (85%) decreasing to 51.9% in May and then increasing again to 82.4% in June and 73.3% in July. These percentages were used as the basis for a uniform prior on each `rho_q` (Table 2). We assumed that the spawning percentage during the fourth quarter, October to December, was similar to that during the second quarter.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="priors-recruitment">
				<h3>Recruitment</h3>
				<p>Following Mangel et al. (2010) the prior for stock-recruitment steepness is based on a beta probability distribution function for a precursor parameter</p>
				<p class="equation">`dot(eta) ~ B(.)`</p>
				<p class="equation">`eta = (dot(eta)+0.25)/1.25`</p>
				<p>where `B(.)` is the beta distribution. This formulation allows for `eta` to be constrained between 0.2 and 1. </p>
