		<p class="note">
			This documentation is a draft under active development. 
			Throughout this documents notes like this one indicate potential changes or refinements to the model.
			Separate documentation, generated from the model's C++ source code, is also

			<h2 id="symbols">Symbols</h2>
			<p>The following convention is used for assigning symbols for the model: Greek lower case letters (e.g. `alpha`) for model parameters, Roman capital letters (e.g. `N`) for arrays of model variables, and Roman lower case letters for array subscripts (e.g. `N_{r,a,s}`). This means that in some instances model parameters are given different symbols that usual.</p>
			<p>The table below lists and briefly describes each model symbol and provides a link to the section in this document where they are more fully detailed</p>

			<h2 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h2>
			<p>There are several model dimensions that are used to partition both the fish population and fishing catches.</p>
			<h3>Region</h3>
			There are three regions, West (`w`), Maldives (`m`) and East (`e`).
			<p class="note">The term "region" is used over "area" becausing using the latter would confound the `a` subscript which is also used for age.</p>

			<p class="equation">`N_{r,a,s} = sum_{dot(r) in {w,m,e},dot(s)=0...S}( dot(N)_{dot(r),a,dot(s)} G_{dot(s),s} M_{dot(r),r} S )`</p>

			<h2 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h2>
			<p class="note">
				Currently, recruitment is pooled across all areas and divided equally. This could be changed via a recruitment
