This section summarizes the performance of the `Mald2016` management procedure using the evaluation methods described above. It is important to note that `Mald2016` is based on the results of stock assessments performed every three years. However the management procedure does not specify how that assessment should be conducted (e.g. what data weightings should be used). As such, it can be considered to be a Harvest Control Rule (HCR), rather than a full managment procedure. 

In these evaluations we did not attempt to simulate a fixed stock assessment process (e.g. by assuming a simple assessment done using a biomass dynamics model, or by simulating a full Stock Synthesis based assessment). There is likely to be variation, perhaps substantial, in the methods and data used in assessments and subsequently variation in both the accuracy and precision (both unknown) of future assessments. We assumed that there was a no bias and a 10% coefficient of variation in the precision of assessment estimates of stock status. However, even given these optimistic assumptions, the evaluation results show a deterioration in the performance of the MP in the long term (there is a significant proportion of simulations where after 25 years stock biomass falls below 25% B0). In the Discussion we suggest alternative ways that these issues could be addressed.


The suggested base control parameter values for this MP are:

- Maximum fishing intensity |I_{max} = 100%|
- Threshold level |T = 40%|
- Safety (closure) level |X = 10%|
- Maximum TAC |C_{max} = 900,000t|
- Maximum change in TAC |D_{max} = 30%|


The resulting performance statistics given this set of control parameters are provided in {refer #table-mald2016-perf-stats} and catch and biomass trajectories are shown in {refer #figure-mald2016-trajs}.

This section examines the sensitivity of the performance statistics to alternative values of control parameters for the `Mald2016` management procedures. This was done by individually varying each of the control parameters whilst keeping the remainder at their base value. In the following figures, distributions for four key performance statistics are presented at each level of each control parameter.

In addition to "one-by-one" changes in each of the control parameters, a grid of values was evaluated using every combinations of the following set of values:

  - Maximum fishing intensity |Imax =| {0.9, 1.0, 1.1}
  - Threshold level |T =| {0.3, 0.4, 0.5}
  - Safety (closure) level |X =| {0.0, 0.1, 0.2}
  - Maximum TAC |C_{max} =| {700000, 800000, 900000}

This allows for identification of combinations of parameters that may be preferred over the combination of parameters presente din the suggested base set.
